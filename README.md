# Spring Design Patterns and Best Practices [Video]
This is the code repository for [Spring Design Patterns and Best Practices [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/spring-5-design-patterns-and-best-practices-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788291897), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
This video will take you through Design Patterns and considerations required with the Spring framework. You will learn to use these design patterns to solve common problems when designing an application or system using the Spring Framework. This video will not only take you through ten of the essential GoF Design Patterns but also categories of patterns, considerations, and best practices required at different stages of Application Development. 
Design Patterns help us write software that is flexible and future-proof. If youâ€™re overusing if tests, you are probably not writing a well-designed object-oriented program. You will see how to use several design patterns, instead of if tests, to write a program where logic resides in an optimal location. The examples in this course use the command pattern, decorator pattern, visitor pattern, and several others.
You will understand the Dependency Injection pattern that is the main principle behind the decoupling process that Spring does, thus making it easier to manage your code. With practical examples, you will understand how patterns listed under the GoF patterns can be used in your Application Design. You will be introduced to the MVC pattern and how it treats controllers as Plain Old Java Objects, thus making it easier for testing the controllers. You will then learn about the Factory Method, and how it relates to one of the core components of object-oriented design: polymorphism.
